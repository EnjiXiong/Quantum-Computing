> 💡 *Tip:* Always read with a purpose — whether to survey literature, review, or deepen understanding for your research.  
> Focus on both “what the paper did” and “how I would have done it differently.”  
> The ultimate goal: polynomial-time reading, exponential-time thinking, and constant-time output (P-E-C).
